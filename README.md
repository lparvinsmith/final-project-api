WDI Project 4 -- back-end

Typewriter was created for my final project at General Assembly Web Development Immersive. This app uses a Node.js and Express back-end with an Angular.js front-end to help writers complete their stories in sections, with tools for uploading images and drawing directly in the app. The app uses PostgreSQL to store data, and Sketch.js for drawing tools.

Deployed app: http://lparvinsmith.github.io/typewriter/

Front-end repo: https://github.com/lparvinsmith/typewriter
